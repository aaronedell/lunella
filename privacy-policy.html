    <h1>Lunella Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 23, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Lunella ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>Lunella does not collect, transmit, or share any of your personal data.</strong></p>

    <p>All data you enter into the App, including your cycle start date and any related health information, is stored locally on your device only. This data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remains on your device at all times</li>
        <li>Is never transmitted to our servers or any third-party services</li>
        <li>Is not accessible to us or anyone else</li>
        <li>Is stored using iOS's secure local storage mechanisms (App Groups and UserDefaults)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Lunella does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not use cookies, beacons, or any other tracking technologies.</p>

    <h2>No User Accounts</h2>
    <p>The App does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is protected by iOS's built-in security features. Since all data remains on your device, it is protected by your device's passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID. We recommend keeping your device secure and up to date.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all data stored by Lunella at any time by deleting the App from your device. This will permanently remove all locally stored information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Lunella is intended for use by adults and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Lunella is a tracking tool only and is not intended as medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult your healthcare provider for medical advice and follow the prescribing information for your contraceptive device.</p>
